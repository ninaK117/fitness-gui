1) Why did I put the includeSecondary first?

Allows for short-circuit evaluation. If includeSecondary is false, the expression stops being evaluated as soon as includeSecondary is determined.

2) We choose ArrayList over Vector because...?

We chose ArrayList because it is faster than vectors and not as costly. ArrayList is faster because it is not synchronized and it is not as costly because it has a slower growth compared to vectors. 

3) How do we get the name of an enumeration value?

enumName.name() returns the name of an enumeration value? as a string. 

4) What is this thing?

This is a serial version ID. It gaurantees the same serial version ID if you happen to change something within a class and save it at different times. 

5) What is serialization?

Serialization is the act of representing an object as a sequence of bytes. These bytes represent the object's data, type, and types of data stored within it. An object that is serialized can then be deserialized by recreating the object in memory.
